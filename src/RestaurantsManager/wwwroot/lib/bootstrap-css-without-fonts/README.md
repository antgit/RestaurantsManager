# Bootstrap CSS without glyphicons/fonts

This is a Bower component for [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS without font libraries. No javascript contained in this component. Perfect companion for [Angular-UI Bootstrap](https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap-bower) which implements the javascript part of bootstrap.

All glyphicons/fonts are moved out of the css rules.

## Installation:

`bower install bootstrap-css-without-fonts`
