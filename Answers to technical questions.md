1. I spent 4 hr. I want to add busy indicator, improve design, logs, separate library to work with REST Api, localization, minification and bundling of source files.
2. I like "string interpolation" feature, which was added in the last version of C#.

	```cs
    $"{resource}?{paramString}"
	```

3. I can use custom performance measuring tools, implemented using Stopwatch class and default Visual Studio possibilities to measure performance in my project.
4. I would add operations like "Skip" and "Take" to JUST EAT APIs to implement grid with paging. It will decrease loading time for restaurants and server load.
